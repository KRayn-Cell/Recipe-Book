<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul><li>large eggs2</li><li>whole milk 1<sup>1/2</sup>tbsp</li><li>vanilla extract 1/4tsp</li> <li>cake flour 1/4cup</li><li>baking powder 1/2tsp</li><li>sugar 2tbsp</li><li>neutral flavor oil 1tbsp</li><li>water 2tbsp</li></ul>
<h1>Ingredient Prep</h1>
<ol><li>seperate egg yolks from egg whites</li><li>put egg whites into the frezzer for 15 mins</li></ol>
<h1>Cooking Process</h1>
<ol><li>Add milk and vanilla extract to the egg yolks and wisk until thick and frothy</li><li>Sift the cake flour and baking powder into the bowl</li><li>Whisk to combine but be sure not to over mix then set to the side</li><li>After 15 mins the edd whites sould be half frozen start beating the egg whites</li><li>When the egg whites turn frothy and pale white, gradually add in sugar (roughly ⅓ at a time). Continue to whip the egg whites.</li><li>The egg whites will become glossier and firmer. Stop beating when you lift up the hand mixer and the egg whites stand right up with stiff peaks slightly bending over.</li><li>Heat the large non-stick frying pan to 300 ºF (150 ºC) over the lowest heat. Brush with cooking oil and lightly remove any visible oil (otherwise the pancakes will have spotty pattern). Keep the heat on while you combine egg whites and egg yolk mixture. </li><li>Transfer the egg yolk mixture into egg whites. Carefully fold in two mixtures together without breaking the air bubbles. Make sure to gently mix the batter thoroughly!</li><li>For my stove and frying pan, I kept 300 ºF (150 ºC) all times on low heat.  Remember each pancake gets roughly 4 scoops of batter, so that’s total of 12 scoops for 3 pancakes. Now, scoop the batter and place on the frying pan. My recommendation is to use a small ladle (or a serving spoon that’s bigger than regular spoon - probably 2-3 Tbsp) and make a tall pancake. Next, stack one more scoop to the first pancake. Then move on to the next two pancakes giving each 2 small scoops.</li><li>By the time all 3 pancakes have 2 scoops, the surface of batter is slightly dry already, so you can stack one more scoop on top, keeping it up high. In the bowl, you should still have roughly 3 scoops left (if you have slightly more, that’s okay).</li><li>Set timer for 6-7 minutes, add 1 Tbsp water in 3 empty spaces inside the pan and cover with the lid. Water keeps the pancake moist. Please note: the suggested time is just a guideline and it’s based on the stove and frying pan that I'm using.</li><li>After 2 minutes passed, open the lid, and add one more scoop for each pancake (or more scoops if you have more batter). Make sure to stack high, not wide. If the water has evaporated, add a little bit more. Cover with lid and cook.
</li><li>After 6-7 minutes passed, using the offset spatula, lift the pancake VERY GENTLY. If you feel the pancake is stuck, don’t touch until they firm up a little. If you force it, the pancake will crack in the middle. When the pancake is ready, you can easily move the pancake.</li><li>Here is another set of images to show the process. Slightly pull the pancake to create an empty space and gently flip over with “rolling over” motion.</li><li>Add water in empty spaces and set timer for 4 to 5 minutes to cook the other side on the lowest heat.</li><li>Once they are nicely browned, transfer the pancakes to your serving plates. </li></ol>
